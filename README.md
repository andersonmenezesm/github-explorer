Project React.JS

<p>

__Whats is project?__ <br /> <br />
*This was an application developed during the Rocketseat bootcamp (GoStack 11). It consists of an application that searches the repository using the Github API.* <br /> <br /> <br />

## Installing / Getting started

This application will soon be available for access and use.

### Initial Configuration

Just use the git clone and then use the command: yarn, to install the project dependencies.

## Developing

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/andersonmenezesm/teotalk.git
cd github-explorer/
yarn
```

And state what happens step-by-step.

## Features

* Search repositories
* Saves to DB Storage
* React JS interface
* Server in Node JS

## Configuration

You can use design to inspire your projects and build interfaces 
that are able to create a bridge between the user and your application.

## Contributing

When you publish something open source, one of the greatest motivations is that
anyone can just jump in and start contributing to your project.

These paragraphs are meant to welcome those kind souls to feel that they are
needed. You should state something like:

"If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a feature
branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome."

If there's anything else the developer needs to know (e.g. the code style
guide), you should link it here. If there's a lot of things to take into
consideration, it is common to separate this section to its own file called
`CONTRIBUTING.md` (or similar). If so, you should say that it exists here.
